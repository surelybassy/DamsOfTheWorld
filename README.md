# The Data

The data set came from the World Bank Data Catalog and contains information about 6155 dams around the world.

## Cleaning

Of the 59 features in the data set, several contained mostly null values or information that would provide little analytical insight, so these were dropped.

Looking at the data in the purpose column, I could see several spelling errors and variations, so cleaned these up to make things more standardised. 

# Analysis

### Purposes

From the information in the data set, we can see that at least 45% of the dams are used for irrigation purposes, 34% provide some sort of hydroelectricity and 5% are used to provide water.
